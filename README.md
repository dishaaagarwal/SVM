# SVM

## Main Aim

1. In this repository I have implemented and experimented with various parameters of SVM in order to gain more knowledge on how SVM behaves with *Linear* as well has *Non-     Linear Data.*

2. For better understanding I have plotted my resuts using a *Desicion Boundary*.

3. I have created this repository for knowlegde purpose .



## Dataset

For this repository I have used a simple Iris Dataset for better understanding.


## Table of Content

-. Implement SVM using Linear Data (Hard & Soft SVM)
-. Create Non-Linear Data
- Soft & Hard SVM on non-linear data
- Linear SVM on non-linear data 
- Experimenting with Regularization parameter(C)
- Experimenting with gamma values on non-linear data.
- Experimenting with gamma values on linear data.
- Showing the effect of different gamma values.
